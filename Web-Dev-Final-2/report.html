    <h1>Report: Final Coursework Submission</h1>
    <h2>Cameron Pope</h2>
    <h4 class="section-heading">Introduction</h4>
    <p>My website is designed to be a GT3 fanpage about the Blancpain endurance world series a and wiki that serves as a purpose to collate information about the series in one place. I chose this because myself, as well as a few friends have a passion for motorsport and in particular the GT3 series. I also noticed that the official website of the series was at times hard to navigate, and had a lot of missing or incomplete stats and data. For example, there were no offical specifications for any of the cars, and a lot of data, such as fastest laps, were missing from a lot of the tracks. My aim was to collect all of this data from the relevant official sources and collate it all into a website for easy access and viewing.</p>
    
    <h4 class="section-heading">State 3 things that inspired you when creating your website</h4>
    <p>The thing that inspired me the most was my love for motorsport and I wanted to create something that I had a passion for. This is also echoed by some of my friends so these friends became souces of advice and ideas for what they would like to see in a website, and ways to improve on early desgins.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Another source of inspiration for me was, as discussed briefly in the introduction, a lack of completeness and in some regards, usability of the official website. I found it frustrating that a lot of data was imcomplete or missing, and the data that was there was hard to find. I wanted to collect all of the data and simplify the way it is presented, so it is easy to locate and read so users did not have to spend long periods of time trying to locate what they were looking for.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Finally, I had also noticed many wiki/informational websites were very poorly desgined, hard to read and hard to navigate. It inspired me to want to create a website that put usability and readability first and foremost, so navigation was as easy as possible for the user.</p>
    
    <h4 class="section-heading">State 3 ways your website is accessible</h4>
    <p>As briefly stated above, accessibility was a core goal when designing and building my website. First of all, myself, as well as members of my friends and family, suffer from Deuteranopia, which is a colour deficiency predominantly affecting red, green and brown colours. Because of this, I wanted my website to accessilbe to users with all variances of colour deficiencies. The colour scheme I chose reflects this, sporting a largely greyscale scheme where possible. Whilst this removes from the overall aesthetic and appearance of the website, I wanted the website to be as accessible for as many people as possible.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Another way in which I have made my website accessible is adding alt tags to all the images. This is to ensure anybody visiting the website who has a screen reader, or in the event the images do not load properly, they are still able get the desired experience and information from the site. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Finally, </p>
    
    <h4 class="section-heading">State 3 ways you have considered usability in your site</h4>
    <p>My points mentioned about about accessibilty also tie in to my consideration for usability. The strict design choices I make to make the site accessible for as many as possible have meant the site is much simpler to understand and use for the average user, as well as vastly improving the usability for those user mentioned above when I discussed the design choices regarding accessibilty. If it weren't for these considerations, the site could become unsuable for certain demographics.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Another way I considered uasbility was when designing the layout of the pages and certain aspects of the functionality. I tried to stick to industry "standards" - for example, a sticky navigation bar along the top of the page, a footer with information about the page and contact details, and a logo that acts as a homepage button. I tried not to stray far from these standards to ensure that any user will be able feel familiar with how to navigate and find information on the site.</p>
